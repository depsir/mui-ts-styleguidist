# mui-ts-styleguidist
A minimal setup to make material-ui, typescript and react-styleguidist work together

Disclaimer: this is a work in progress. I'm trying to figure out if it is even possible. HELP WANTED!

# Desired behaviour
- Component shown in styleguide
- Props shown with type, required, default and description
- Props from material ui (classes, ref) not shown

# Start styleguidist server

    npm install
    npm run start
